### Suggest an App

[Suggest an App](http://suggestanapp.co)

Suggest an app is project #1 in my [12 Apps in 12 Months](http://mandym.com/2015/03/announcing-the-12-apps-in-12-months-challenge/) Challenge.

I chose to build it for a couple reasons:

- I wanted to get some exposure to Meteor without having to start from scratch
- I intend to ask my friends to suggest ideas for the challenge so having a place for them to suggest them seemed like a good idea

### Stack

Suggest an App is built using [Telescope](http://www.telescopeapp.org/) with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and is mostly out of the box functionality.  I did do some styling changes and some layout/functionalty changes but it was mostly turnkey.

### Roadmap

The site as it stands is an MVP.  You can check my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Qk4xdOlG/challenge-month-1) board for planned additional functionality.
